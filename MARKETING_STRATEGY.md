# Marketing Strategy: Startups & Solopreneurs in SF

## Target Niche: Early-Stage Startups & Solopreneurs

### Who They Are

- **Pre-seed to Series A startups** (1-20 employees) across the US
- **Solopreneurs** building their first real business
- **New business owners** who need proper bookkeeping from day one
- **Technical and non-technical founders** who hate accounting but need credibility
- **Too small for QuickBooks** but too serious for spreadsheets
- **Need investor-ready numbers** but don't have a CFO

### Core Pain Points

1. **"We don't have a system"** - Everything is scattered (Stripe, spreadsheets, Notion)
2. **"QuickBooks feels like enterprise software"** - Too complex, too dated, too accountant-focused
3. **"We need investor-ready numbers"** - Must present burn rate, runway, MMRR confidently
4. **"We make decisions blind"** - Hiring/spending without knowing actual burn or runway
5. **"I hate accounting"** - Feel guilty about messy books but overwhelmed by complexity

### What They Need

✅ **Simple bookkeeping foundation** - Not complicated, not overkill  
✅ **FP&A-lite for non-finance founders** - Burn rate, runway, cash flow forecasts  
✅ **Investor-ready reporting** - P&L, cash flow, burn charts, spend analysis  
✅ **AI-driven financial narrative** - "What happened, why, and what to fix"  
✅ **Mobile-first** - Founders do finances in transit  
✅ **Immediate value** - See burn/runway/spend categories the moment they connect
