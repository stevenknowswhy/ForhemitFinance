# Executive Summary — EZ Financial Roadmap Alignment

## 1. North Star

**Radical Simplicity:**

Founders shouldn't need to learn accounting to have excellent accounting.

## 2. High-Level Status

- **Infrastructure (Next.js, Convex, Clerk, schema)**: 100% complete
- **Dashboard UI (KPI cards, charts, search)**: strong and usable today
- **Backend reporting engine**: ahead of the UI
- **Core differentiator (AI double-entry preview + explanations + approval UI)**: not built yet

## 3. Critical Gaps

1. **AI Double-Entry Preview** — Core differentiator, not implemented
2. **AI Explanation System** ("I chose this because…")
3. **Transaction Approval Workflow UI** — Backend ready, UI missing
4. **Personal/Business Tagging UI** — Schema ready, UI missing
5. **Real Plaid integration** — Currently using mock data

## 4. Roadmap Alignment Summary

- **Phase 1 MVP**: ~40% done (backend there, UX not there)
- **Phase 2+ (AI Stories, Goals, Forecasting, Tax)**: correctly deferred and schema-ready
  - **AI Stories (Forhemit Finance Stories)** - Core Phase 2 feature: Three tailored narratives (Company, Banker, Investor) auto-generated monthly/quarterly/annually

## 5. 6–8 Week MVP Critical Path

1. Build AI double-entry preview
2. Build approval workflow UI
3. Add Personal/Business tagging
4. Replace mock Plaid with real Plaid
5. Connect preview → approval → final books flow

## 6. Principle: "Simplicity Is the Product"

Every feature and decision must reduce cognitive load. If it adds complexity, it doesn't ship.

**Phase 1 is ONLY about making it effortless to get clean books: AI suggestions + one-tap approvals.**

Everything else (goals, narratives, tax, forecasting) is Phase 2+ and must not complicate core flows.
