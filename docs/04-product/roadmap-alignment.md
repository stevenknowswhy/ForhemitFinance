# Roadmap Alignment — Document Index

This document has been split into two focused documents for clarity and consistency.

## Document Structure

### 1. [Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
**Audience:** Founders, advisors, investors, product stakeholders  
**Length:** 1-2 pages  
**Purpose:** High-level status, critical gaps, and MVP critical path

### 2. [PRD — Phase 1 MVP](./PRD_PHASE_1_MVP.md)
**Audience:** Engineering, design, product  
**Length:** Detailed technical specification  
**Purpose:** Complete feature definitions, user flows, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria

### 3. [PRD — Phase 2: AI Stories](./PRD_PHASE_2_AI_STORIES.md)
**Audience:** Engineering, design, product  
**Length:** Detailed technical specification  
**Purpose:** Complete specification for AI Stories feature (Company Story, Banker Story, Investor Story)

## Quick Reference: Phase 1 Priority Order

**Single Source of Truth:**

1. **AI Double-Entry Preview** — Core differentiator
2. **Transaction Approval Workflow UI** — Core MVP feature
3. **Personal/Business Tagging** — Important differentiator
4. **Real Plaid Integration** — Production readiness

**Phase 2 (explicitly deferred):**
- **AI Stories (Forhemit Finance Stories)** ⭐ **Core Phase 2 Feature**
  - Company Story (internal use - CEO, CFO, employees)
  - Banker/Creditor Story (for banks, lenders, creditors)
  - Investor Story (for investors, VCs, angels)
  - Auto-generated monthly, quarterly, annually
  - User can add notes, attachments, export in multiple formats
  - Signature feature: "Competitors have dashboards; you have dashboards + storytelling intelligence"
- Goal-Based Budgeting
- Forecasting
- Tax prep views
- Accountant collaboration
- Receipt OCR

## Core Principle

**"Simplicity is not a feature. It's the product."**

Phase 1 is ONLY about making it effortless to get clean books: AI suggestions + one-tap approvals.

Everything else (goals, narratives, tax, forecasting) is Phase 2+ and must not complicate core flows.
